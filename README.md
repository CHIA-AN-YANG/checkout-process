---

## Installation
You can clone this project from here: [github link](https://github.com/CHIA-AN-YANG/checkout-process.git)
### 1. Clone and install
Clone with HTTPs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CHIA-AN-YANG/checkout-process.git
```
Alternatively, clone with SSH:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:CHIA-AN-YANG/checkout-process.git
```
Run npm install to install required plugins.
```
npm install
```

## Usage 
Before start this project locally, check if you have installed an SSL certificate for `localhost`. If not, you may get the warning message that the site is not secure.
To use HTTP for localhost, comment out the HTTPS setting in `vue.config.js` accordingly:
```
//vue.config.js
//module.exports = { devServer: { https: true } }
```
### 1. Compile and minify for production
Since webpack comes with Vue-cli and does the minification, it does not require external task runners.
```
npm run build
```
### 2. Compile and hot-reload
```
npm run serve
```

## Unit Test
This mock uses **Vue Test Utils** - the official unit testing utility library for Vue.js. 
Run the following script for unit testing:
```
npm run test:unit
```
